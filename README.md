# Pivotal-Spring-Professional-Certification

After OCA certification, my next step is to get the Pivotal Spring Professional Certification. Compare to OCA, the questions are not that trick as OCA, but the materal is way much harder than the OCA. It took me around 4 months to prepare it during the summer of 2019. But the Pivotal change the strategy of the exam, the put more Spring Boot configuration and Spring Boot Acatuator. <br />
I failed my first exam on 9/2019 with score 68, the passing score is 76. The reasons that I fail are mainly three aspects:  <br />
1. Not familiar with new stuff especially Spring Boot Configuration and Spring Boot Acatuator.  <br />
2. Didn't do well on data access part  <br />
3. Missing some deatils from the Spring offical documentations.  <br />

To do(future plan):  <br />
1. Buy the newly published pivotal spring professional study guide and go over some details.  <br />
2. Read the upadted core spring 5 certification in detail by Ivan  <br />
3. Read offcial documentation again especially on the data access part and the Spring Boot Acatuator.

Some resources that I use:  <br />
1. Udemey Spring course  <br />
2. Spring 5 in action  <br />
3. core spring 5 certification in detail  <br />
4. Moss Github Repository  <br />

Plan to retake the exam on January or February 2020. Would keep updating the status.
